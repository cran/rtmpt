\title{Set process completion times equal}
\usage{
tau2tau(model, names, outcome, keep_zeros = FALSE)

set_taus_equal(model, names, outcome, keep_zeros = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A list of the class \code{ertmpt_model}.}

\item{names}{Character vector giving the names of the processes for which the process completion times should be equal. If 
\code{length(names) = 1} then the corresponding process completion times (for negative and positive outcomes) will be 
estimates (i.e., they will be set to NA)}

\item{outcome}{Character (no vector) indicating for which process outcome the process completion times should 
be set equal. Allowed characters are:
\itemize{
 \item \code{"minus"}: the negative outcome of the processes.
 \item \code{"plus"}: the positive outcome of the processes.
 \item \code{"both"}: the negative and positive outcome of the processes. This will set all process completion times for
   the "minus" outcome equal and all process completion times for the "plus" outcome equal.
}}

\item{keep_zeros}{Can be one of the following
\itemize{
 \item logical value: \code{FALSE} (default) means none of the zeros for \code{names} in the \code{model} will be kept; The times of
   the reference process (i.e., first of \code{names} in alphabetical order) will be set to \code{NA} (i.e., will be estimated) and the others
   will be set to the name of the reference process (i.e., will be set to equal the reference process times). \code{TRUE} means
   the zero(s) of the reference process times (if specified) is used for the same outcome of all other processes. 
 \item numeric value: index for \code{names}. If 1, the zero(s) of the first process in \code{names} (in original order defined by the user) is 
   used for the same outcome of all other processes in \code{names}. If 2, the zero(s) of the second process is used. And so on.
}}
}
\value{
A list of the class \code{ertmpt_model}.
}
\description{
Setting multiple process completion times (taus) equal. This means all process times of negative outcomes will be
  set equal and all process times of positive outcomes will be set equal. Only two process times (one for the negative
  and one for the positive outcome) of the named processes will be estimated. The equality can be removed by just 
  naming only one process name.
}
\note{
If you use \code{theta2theta()} and \code{tau2tau()} with the same process names you might just change the EQN or MDL file accordingly
  by using the same process name for all processes which should have equal process times and probabilities.
